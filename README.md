# Mental Health Chatbot 

As we are moving towards modernization people are facing issue sharing their feelings with someone or about their day, So seeing this problem I tried to leverage my knowlege of machine learning to make a model which can predict a humans emotion, the accuracy is 90%. 

The model gets the prompt of the user and respond to it with the dataset provided in json format as the time complexity to find the answer to the prompt would be O(1).

## Web-app

Keeping the appp to myself was not my plan my idea was to server the world with my creation would not say its is best but yes could be better than which other could not access. For, the front-end I used Html,css,Javascript to construct the chatbot window and how much gap there should be between user and bot replies.
was fun doing that and learnt few things which I had no idea about. I guess that is what computer science learning via doing the stuff.

For backend I used Flask framework as it is light-weight and easy for development purposes. I connected it with my fornt-end and then it took me not much time to see how my website was working and how my chatbot was responding found few errors but at the end of the day I fixed 'em.
