# Mental Health Chatbot 

As we move towards modernization, people are facing issues with sharing their feelings or talking about their day. To address this problem, I leveraged my knowledge of machine learning to create a model that can predict human emotions, achieving an accuracy of 90%.

The model receives a user's prompt and responds using a dataset provided in JSON format. The time complexity for finding the answer to a prompt is O(1).

## Web App
I didn't intend to keep the app to myself; my goal was to share my creation with the world. While it might not be the best, it certainly provides value that others might not have access to. For the front-end, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct the chatbot window and manage the spacing between user and bot replies. It was enjoyable to work on this and I learned a lot of new things, which is a big part of computer science‚Äîlearning by doing.

For the backend, I used the Flask framework because it is lightweight and easy for development purposes. I connected it with the front-end, and it didn't take long to see how my website was functioning and how the chatbot was responding. I encountered a few errors, but I managed to fix them by the end of the day.
